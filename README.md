# SmartStall Bluetooth Peripheral API

This document describes the public-facing **Bluetooth GATT API** for the SmartStall touchless locking system. It is intended for developers building Bluetooth central clients (e.g., ESP32-based hubs) that connect to SmartStall peripherals.

The SmartStall device is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripheral. It advertises a custom GATT service that exposes:
- BLE device name **SmartStall**
- Stall lock **status** (enum values)
- **Reference Switch** (locked/unlocked position sensor)
- **Battery voltage** (in millivolts)

> **Note:** The Bluetooth MAC address of the SmartStall device is not exposed in the GATT profile. Use the 6-byte Device ID (MAC address) for identification.

## Characteristics

### ðŸŸ¦ Stall Status

- **UUID**: `47d80a44-c552-422b-aa3b-d250ed04be37`  
- **Properties**: `READ`  
- **Format**: `uint16_t`  
- **Description**: Indicates the current state of the stall lock.

#### Enum Values

| Value | Name             | Description                                         |
|------:|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `1`   | `STATE_INIT`     | Device booted, reporting initialization             |
| `2`   | `STATE_LOCKED`   | Stall is physically locked                          |
| `3`   | `STATE_UNLOCK`   | Stall has been unlocked                             |
| `4`   | `STATE_OPEN`     | Stall door has been opened                          |
| `5`   | `STATE_CLOSED`   | Stall door has been closed                          |
| `6`   | `STATE_SLEEP`    | Entering sleep mode                                 |
| `7`   | `LOCK_TIMEOUT`   | 20-minute timeout occurred                          |
| `8`   | `LOW_BATT`       | Battery too low to operate                          |

### ðŸŸ¨ Reference Switch

- **UUID**: `2f8a5c10-8d9e-4b7f-9c11-0d2e5b7a4f22`  
- **Properties**: `READ`  
- **Format**: `uint8_t` (boolean-like)  
- **Description**: Hardware reference indicating the **actual mechanical position** of the lock, independent of software state.

#### Values

| Value | Meaning      |
|------:|--------------|
| `0`   | UNLOCKED     |
| `1`   | LOCKED       |

> Use this to cross-check `Stall Status` or for safety interlocks.

### ðŸŸ© Battery Voltage

- **UUID**: `7d108dc9-4aaf-4a38-93e3-d9f8ff139f11`  
- **Properties**: `READ`  
- **Format**: `uint16_t`  
- **Units**: Millivolts (mV)  
- **Description**: Most recent measured battery voltage of the device (typically measured at boot).

> Example: `4910` â†’ `4.910 V`

## BLE Advertisement

- **GAP Device Name**: **`SmartStall`**
- The SmartStall peripheral advertises with:
  - Connectable mode
  - Its 128-bit service UUID

---

## Interaction Workflow

1. Central (hub) scans and connects to a SmartStall peripheral.
2. Read the desired characteristics as needed:
   - `Stall Status`
   - `Reference Switch`
   - `Battery Voltage`
3. Poll at your preferred cadence to detect changes (since all characteristics are **READ-only**).

---

## Examples

We provide an `examples/` folder to help you build your own **Hub Firmware**:

- `examples/arduino/` â€“ Arduino sketches (e.g., ESP32 using a BLE Central library)  
- `examples/circuitpython/` â€“ CircuitPython scripts for supported boards

**What the examples do**

- Discover all nearby **SmartStall** devices by filtering for the service UUID `c56a1b98-6c1e-413a-b138-0e9f320c7e8b` *(you may also optionally filter by the device name `SmartStall`)*  
- Connect to each device in turn  
- **Poll** the three READ-only characteristics and parse values  
- Expose simple hooks so you can forward data to your back end

**Custom integrations**

The examples are structured so end customers can add cloud integrations such as:
- **AWS** (e.g., AWS IoT Core, Lambda, API Gateway)
- **Azure** (e.g., IoT Hub, Functions)
- Other REST/MQTT endpoints

> Modify the provided publishing stub in each example to push readings upstream (per your security and networking model).

---

## Example Usage (ESP32, pseudocode)

```cpp
connectToSmartStall();

uint16_t status    = readCharacteristic(STALL_STATUS_UUID);
uint8_t  refSwitch = readCharacteristic(REFERENCE_SWITCH_UUID);
uint16_t battMv    = readCharacteristic(BATTERY_VOLTAGE_UUID);

// Example interpretation
bool isLocked = (refSwitch == 1);
```
