# SmartStall Bluetooth Peripheral & Central Hub Architecture

This repository documents two related layers of the SmartStall ecosystem:

1. The **Bluetooth GATT Peripheral API** implemented by each SmartStall lock device.
2. The **Multiâ€‘Device Central Hub Architecture** (reference implementation currently in Particle firmware) that discovers, polls, and publishes data from multiple SmartStall peripherals in a roundâ€‘robin schedule.

If you are integrating a custom hub (ESP32, Linux gateway, etc.), start with the Peripheral API. If you are extending or reâ€‘implementing the hub behavior (scheduling, retries, cloud publishing), also review the Central Hub section below.

> Terminology: "Peripheral" = the SmartStall lock. "Hub" / "Central" = a BLE central client that cycles through multiple peripherals.

## Peripheral Overview

Each SmartStall device is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripheral advertising a custom primary service. The GATT service exposes:
- BLE device name **SmartStall**
- Stall lock **status** (enum values)
- **Reference Switch** (mechanical position sensor)
- **Battery voltage** (millivolts)
- (New) **Sensor Counts** (aggregate internal diagnostic counters) â€“ optional / emerging field

> **Note:** The Bluetooth MAC address of the SmartStall device is not exposed inside a characteristic; it is the standard BLE address. A 6â€‘byte Device ID (MAC) is used by hubs for identity.

## GATT Service Overview (Peripheral)

- **Service UUID**: `c56a1b98-6c1e-413a-b138-0e9f320c7e8b`
- **Characteristics** (current + emerging):

| Characteristic         | UUID                                    | Properties | Type                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stall Status           | `47d80a44-c552-422b-aa3b-d250ed04be37`  | `READ`     | `uint16_t`               | Current logical stall/lock state (see Enums).                               |
| Reference Switch       | `2f8a5c10-8d9e-4b7f-9c11-0d2e5b7a4f22`  | `READ`     | `uint8_t`                | Mechanical position: 0 = UNLOCKED, 1 = LOCKED.                              |
| Battery Voltage (mV)   | `7d108dc9-4aaf-4a38-93e3-d9f8ff139f11`  | `READ`     | `uint16_t`               | Most recent battery voltage (millivolts).                                   |
| Sensor Counts (diag) * | `3e4a9f12-7b5c-4d8e-a1b2-9c8d7e6f5a4b`  | `READ`     | 3 Ã— `uint32_t`           | (Optional / future) Diagnostic counters (limit, IR, hall).                  |

*Sensor Counts characteristic is implemented in the current reference hub firmware expectations; peripheral rollout may be staged. Hubs should tolerate absence (graceful discovery failure without aborting other reads).

## Central Hub Architecture (Reference Implementation)

The Particle-based hub firmware (v1.1.0) implements a deterministic **singleâ€‘shot multiâ€‘device polling loop** designed for scalability and predictable cloud event usage.

### Design Highlights

| Aspect | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Discovery | Opportunistic light scan every 15 s + full scan every 60 s when idle |
| Registry | Inâ€‘RAM entries: lastSeen, lastRead, failureCount (capacity â‰ˆ 12 devices) |
| Poll Model | Roundâ€‘robin; connect â†’ discover â†’ read (status, battery, sensor counts if present) â†’ publish â†’ disconnect |
| Connection Attempts | Up to 3 rapid attempts (â‰ˆ250 ms spacing) |
| Connect Timeout | 10 s (reduced from earlier 15 s) |
| Characteristic Reads | Each with up to 3 retries (â‰ˆ150 ms spacing) |
| Backoff | Dynamic extension after consecutive failures (post-threshold) |
| Stale Skip | Devices unseen >120 s temporarily skipped |
| Event Emission | Single consolidated JSON event per successful poll (`smartstall/data`) |
| Threading | System thread enabled (Particle Device OS â‰¥ 6.2) |

### Rationale: Single-Shot vs Persistent Connections

Short-lived connections reduce handle staleness, lower collision probability when scaling devices, and constrain event count deterministically. Notifications were removed to simplify bandwidth; hubs can later reintroduce selective notification (e.g., Stall Status only) without discarding the polling loop.

### Poll Flow (Per Device)
1. Scheduler selects eligible device (interval + backoff satisfied)  
2. Stop scanning (if active)  
3. Attempt connect (up to 3 tries)  
4. Service & characteristic discovery (resetting cached handles first)  
5. Sequential characteristic reads with retry  
6. Publish consolidated event  
7. Disconnect & resume scanning / scheduling  

### Failure & Backoff Logic

After `MAX_FAILURES_BEFORE_BACKOFF` consecutive failures, each additional failure adds incremental delay (e.g., base + `45 s * (failureCount - 2)`). When a device is newly reâ€‘seen advertising after absence, failure count decays to allow quick reintegration.

### Cloud Event: `smartstall/data`

Example payload (fields may expand; prefer tolerant parsing):

```json
{
  "device": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "timestamp": 1696118400,
  "status": 2,
  "status_name": "LOCKED",
  "battery_mv": 3700,
  "battery_v": 3.70,
  "sensor_counts": {
    "limit_switch": 150,
    "ir_sensor": 89,
    "hall_sensor": 145
  }
}
```

All device data is published as a single consolidated snapshot event to simplify downstream processing.

### Hub Integration Tips

| Need | Guidance |
|------|----------|
| Normalize differing status enums | Implement a mapping layer before cloud publish |
| Reduce BLE airtime | Lengthen scan & poll intervals; keep single-shot pattern |
| Graceful characteristic absence | Treat missing Sensor Counts as benign & continue |
| Event quota pressure | Batch server-side aggregations or increase interval |
| Future notification blend | Add selective notify (status) while retaining poll for battery / counts |

## Change Policy

Additions (new characteristics or JSON fields) are introduced in a backwardâ€‘compatible way. Breaking changes (UUID changes, enum renumbering, field removals) will be clearly documented in release notes.

---

---

## BLE Advertisement

- **GAP Device Name**: **`SmartStall`**
- The SmartStall peripheral advertises with:
  - Connectable mode
  - Its 128-bit service UUID

---

## Basic Peripheral Interaction Workflow (Custom Hubs)

1. Scan for advertisements with Service UUID `c56a1b98-6c1e-413a-b138-0e9f320c7e8b` (optionally filter by name `SmartStall`).
2. Connect; perform service + characteristic discovery each session (avoid stale caching across multiple peripherals).
3. Read required characteristics (`Stall Status`, `Reference Switch`, `Battery Voltage`, plus `Sensor Counts` if present).
4. Disconnect promptly; repeat per device on a schedule informed by your throughput and latency needs.

---

## Examples

The `Examples/` directory contains reference hub code in multiple ecosystems (Arduino/ESP32, CircuitPython, Particle). These implementations demonstrate:
- Filtering by service UUID + name
- Deterministic single-shot polling pattern
- Parse & normalization of characteristic payloads
- Cloud publish stubs ready for integration (REST, MQTT, AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, etc.)

> Extend the provided publishing stubs to fit your security, batching, or compression strategy.

---

## Example Usage (ESP32, pseudocode)

```cpp
connectToSmartStall();

uint16_t status    = readCharacteristic(STALL_STATUS_UUID);
uint8_t  refSwitch = readCharacteristic(REFERENCE_SWITCH_UUID);
uint16_t battMv    = readCharacteristic(BATTERY_VOLTAGE_UUID);

// Example interpretation
bool isLocked = (refSwitch == 1);
```
